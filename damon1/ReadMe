Damon1, version 1.2.01, March 21, 2017, copyright Pythias Consulting, LLC, 
Vancouver, Washington.

Get Started
-----------
1.  Review the documentation on the Pythias website, www.pythiasconsulting.com.

2.  Follow the instructions ("Download") for downloading Numpy and Python.  I
recommend either the Anaconda or Enthought distributions.

3.  Open the Python interpreter, called IDLE.

4.  In the IDLE menu, go to File/Open Module.  Type:  damon1.templates.blank.  A 
Python scripting window will pop up.  

5.  Save damon1.templates.blank under a new name in a directory of your choice.

6.  Hit the F5 key.  This will automatically load all the required modules 
for running damon.

7.  Start programming.  The template script gives basic information on the 
commands you will need and how to access help.

8.  When you get stuck, contact me through the Forum link on the website.

Dependencies
------------
Python -- version 2.5 or higher, but not 3.0 or higher.

Numpy -- the most recent version that is compatible with Python.

matplotlib -- this is optional, for creating graphs and other visuals.

It is recommended that you get either the free Anaconda distribution (Continuum
Analytics) or the Enthought distribution.  Both include Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, 
and a large suite of other numerical computing tools.  They ensure that all 
relevant software packages are mutually compatible.

Changes
-------
This version included a lot of new work with standard error estimation.

Fixed bug in tools.median().

In Damon.__init__(), used new tool functions to avoid numpy deprecation
warnings.

In Damon.__init__(), improved handling of floats in validchars.

In tools.flag_invalid() extended formula to allow counts as proportions.

In Damon.coord(), expanded the condcoord_ parameter to allow specification
of the 'first' facet for which to calculate coordinates.

In Damon.equate(), fixed bugs that messed up rescaling in anchored analysis 
designs.

In Damon.__init__(), forced index to be integer to get around deprecation
waring raised by latest version of Numpy.

In Damon.extract_valid(), added capacity to check row and column entities
against a bank.

In Damon.fin_est(), changed conversion back to ratio scale to remove
requirement to have same original mean, sd.

In Damon.base_est(), added functionality to refit parameter to allow 
control of the degree of the fit. Removed functionality for standardizing
base estimates.

In Damon.base_ear(), changed how Damon is used to calculate standard
errors, opting for a 2-dimensional log solution.

In Damon.equate(), changed the SE and EAR aggregation formula to sum across
log coordinates.  This causes a slight negative error estimation bias 
in equate() relative to the RMSE type of aggregation used in summstat(). 
Added a "group_se" option. 

In Damon.summstat(), added a "group_se" option to control the aggregation
of standard errors for measures.
